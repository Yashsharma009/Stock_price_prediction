Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

```plaintext

==================================

Overview
--------------
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices. It includes data retrieval using Yahoo Finance, data preprocessing, building an LSTM model, and predicting stock prices.

Prerequisites
--------------
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, yfinance, scikit-learn, keras

Installation
--------------
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn keras
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/Yashsharma009/Stock_price_prediction.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

4. Run the code:
   ```
   python stock_prediction.py
   ```

Usage
--------------
1. Modify the `start`, `end`, and `stock` variables in the `stock_prediction.py` script to specify the desired stock and time range.

2. Run the script to download stock data, calculate moving averages, preprocess the data, and train an LSTM model.

3. The model will be trained on 80% of the data, and the last 20% will be used for testing. Predicted and original prices will be plotted for comparison.

Data Source
--------------
Stock data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. The specified stock symbol and date range are used for data retrieval.

Code Structure
--------------
- `stock_prediction.py`: Main script for downloading data, preprocessing, training the LSTM model, and making predictions.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing information about the project, its usage, and structure.

Results
--------------
The script generates plots comparing predicted and original stock prices for the test data. Results can be visually analyzed for the accuracy of the model.

Issues and Bugs
--------------
There are no known issues at the moment. If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Contributing
--------------
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Please follow coding standards and provide comprehensive explanations for your changes.
